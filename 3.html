    <h2>javascript</h2>
  <strong>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</strong>often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<p>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[citation needed] It is used to make dynamic webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it[citation needed], and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
